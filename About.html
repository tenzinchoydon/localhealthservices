<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><h3> Health is a multidimensional concept that encompasses both physical and mental well-being. Physical health refers to the proper functioning of the body and its systems, maintained through regular exercise, a balanced diet, adequate rest, and preventive care. Mental health, on the other hand, involves emotional, psychological, and social well-being, affecting how individuals think, feel, and act. It also influences how people handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Both aspects are deeply interconnected—poor physical health can impact mental well-being, and vice versa. In today’s fast-paced world, promoting and maintaining both physical and mental health is essential for leading a balanced and fulfilling life.
